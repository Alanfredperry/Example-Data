# Example-Data
Example Data for testing purposes.

When writing algorithms, code or data processing (Spreadsheet data or by programs / apps) some data is required to enable work to progress. In the first example case Temperature logging data was needed to enable data analysis to be developed. The data is simulated by any means suitable and is not intended to represent any real data except by aproximation. The optional data generation file can be be included. (Often a simple Excel file with charts if it helps to visualise the data)
